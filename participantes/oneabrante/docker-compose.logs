db       | PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
db       | To do so, start the server, then issue the following command:
db       | 
db       | '/usr/bin/mariadb-secure-installation'
db       | 
db       | which will also give you the option of removing the test
db       | databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
db       | strongly recommended for production servers.
