rinha-db     | PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
rinha-db     | To do so, start the server, then issue the following command:
rinha-db     | 
rinha-db     | '/usr/bin/mariadb-secure-installation'
rinha-db     | 
rinha-db     | which will also give you the option of removing the test
rinha-db     | databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
rinha-db     | strongly recommended for production servers.
