db-1     | WARNING: POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD has been set to "trust". This will allow
db-1     |          anyone with access to the Postgres port to access your database without
db-1     |          a password, even if POSTGRES_PASSWORD is set. See PostgreSQL
db-1     |          documentation about "trust":
db-1     |          https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-trust.html
db-1     |          In Docker's default configuration, this is effectively any other
db-1     |          container on the same system.
db-1     | 
db-1     |          It is not recommended to use POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust. Replace
db-1     |          it with "-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password" instead to set a password in
db-1     |          "docker run".
